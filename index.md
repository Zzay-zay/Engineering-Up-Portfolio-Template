# Izaya first robot.
In this program I have spent time building a sunfounder remote controled robot. The coding program that we used is called Arduino. The Ardunio Uno is used to control the robot for example the sensor, motors and recieve signals from the ir remote.

My first milestone was being able to first build the Adruino car, then, be able to code using Arduino IDE allowing the car to move. I also have enough knowledge to be able to talk about in detail what the Arduino Uno microcontroller is and how an H-Bridge works.
