# Izaya first robot.
In this program I have spent time building a sunfounder remote controled robot. The programming language that we used is called Arduino . The Ardunio Uno is used to control the robot for example the sensor, motors and recieve signals from the IR remote.

# Final milestone
 I have come a long way from where I have started 4 weeks ago and I have added some stuff to it. Origanaly I only programed my robot to be able so recieved infrared signals to be able to move by an infrared remote pointing to the Ardunio pointing in any direction. Then gives signals to the breadboard that transmits it to the senor to move backwards. Then i added a buzzer to my robot when the sensor detects something within a sertin distance. To progam to buzz wthin a 30-14cm distance it would beep but within in a 12-3cm distance it would have a faster rate of beeping.

# First Milestone 
My first milestone was being able to first build the Adruino car, then, be able to code using Arduino IDE allowing the car to move. I also have enough knowledge to be able to talk about in detail what the Arduino Uno microcontroller is and how an H-Bridge works.
